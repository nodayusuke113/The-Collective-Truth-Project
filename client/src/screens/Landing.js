                    <p>Crypto was founded and being used heavily because its decentralised. So our mission is to keep the decisions of anyone that way as well. Its open and transparent, and its done by the people. No single body is manipulating in any way.</p>

                    <p>Rather than reaching out to centralised information systems or third party apps for audits. This is a place for experts, investors and explorers of web3 driven by a reward mechanism to produce <b>the collective truth</b>.</p>
